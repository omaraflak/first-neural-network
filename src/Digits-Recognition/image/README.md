# Digits Recognition

Here we use **PNG++** library to read pixels colors from an actual image and then we use the Network class to predict what is drawn on it.

If you take a look to main.cpp file, there is not training part, I'm using pre-trained parameters generated by **/src/Digits-Recognition/main.cpp**.
